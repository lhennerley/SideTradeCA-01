# SideTradeCA-01

Welcome to the Code Academy.

This repository has been created to get you set up and ready for your first training day.

## Introduction to GIT

For those of you who are new to coding for this course, GIT is what we know in the industry as a Version Control System - it's a lot less scary than it sounds! For now, the only explanation you need is that it's a way for us to share code between one and other. The two concepts you will be introduced to at this stage are `repository` and `clone`.

* A repository is simply a folder of code, which can be hosted in the cloud (like we are doing here with Github) where changes by individuals are tracked over time
* `git clone` is just a way for you to get a copy of a repository onto your computer

### Installing GIT on Windows

1. Open a administrative Powershell window
2. Run: `Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))`
3. Run: `choco install git.install`

### Installing GIT on Mac

1. Open Terminal
2. Run: `/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
3. Run: `brew install git`

### Cloning this repository

1. Create a directory where you want to home your code (such as `/Code/SideTradeCodeAcademy`)
2. Open a terminal/command prompt and cd to the directory in 1.
3. Run: `git clone https://github.com/lhennerley/SideTradeCA-01.git`

### Install Integrated Development Environments
